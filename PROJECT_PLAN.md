# Senior Data Analyst Portfolio Project: Geolife Trajectory Analysis

## 1. Project Scope & Objectives

This project analyzes the Microsoft Geolife GPS Trajectories dataset to extract meaningful insights into human mobility patterns. The analysis is designed to be a portfolio-ready showcase of data analysis skills, from data cleaning and feature engineering to advanced spatial analysis and modeling.

### 1.1. Analysis Objectives

#### Objective 1: Mobility Pattern Analysis & Hotspot Detection
*   **Hypothesis:** Users exhibit regular movement patterns, concentrating their time at a few key locations (e.g., home, work). These "stay-points" can be automatically detected and classified using density-based clustering algorithms.
*   **Real-World Value:**
    *   **Urban Planning:** Identify high-traffic zones, residential vs. commercial areas, and points of interest to optimize infrastructure, public transport routes, and zoning regulations.
    *   **Retail & Real Estate:** Pinpoint prime locations for new businesses or housing developments based on population density and movement flows.

#### Objective 2: Transportation Mode Inference
*   **Hypothesis:** The kinematic properties of a trajectory segment (e.g., speed, acceleration, turning angles) can accurately predict the user's mode of transportation (walk, bike, bus, car), even without explicit labels.
*   **Real-World Value:**
    *   **Transportation Logistics:** Understand modal split (the percentage of travelers using a particular type of transportation) to improve public transit services and promote sustainable transport options.
    *   **Context-Aware Advertising:** Deliver targeted promotions based on a user's real-time travel context (e.g., offering a coffee coupon to someone walking near a cafe).

#### Objective 3: User Segmentation based on Movement Behavior
*   **Hypothesis:** Users can be grouped into distinct personas (e.g., "Routine Commuter," "Explorer," "Homebody") based on aggregated features of their movement, such as radius of gyration, travel frequency, and routine index.
*   **Real-World Value:**
    *   **Personalized Services:** Develop user-centric applications, such as personalized travel recommendations or activity suggestions.
    *   **Public Health:** Analyze activity levels and mobility ranges to inform public health studies on physical activity and social interaction.
